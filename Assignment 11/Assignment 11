To stress test or load test an application we need to use applications like jmeter. This application tests our app by creating an illusion of multiple users and putting stress on the application. Generally this will reduce the response time on the application. This will let us know that when do we need to scale up our app. Or when do we need to start thinking of improving our app by reducing the number of requests to database.
