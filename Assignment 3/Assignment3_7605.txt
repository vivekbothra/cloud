Database and Cache (Assignment 3)

The modules that have been imported for this code are 
1. Redis 
2. Random
3. Datetime
4. psycopg2 



redis ==> This package is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, that helps us to bridge the python language and our redis cluster. 

StrictRedis() ==> This method is used to make the connection to the redis cluster that is running on amazon cloud.


psycopg2 ==> This package is a driver that helps the python program to run sql queries on sql database. 


connect() ==> This method comes under the psycopg2 API. This method helps to define the host,username,password and port for the sql database. This basically connects the python code to the PostGreSQL database. 


conn.cursor() ==> this helps the python code to actually perform the POSTGRESQL commands on the database. 


open() ==> This method is built-in method of python which is used to open files with various flags. Giving the code access to the file. 


cur.execute() ==>  This method actually passes the sql command as a string to the cursor, and the cursor further executes this command on the database. 

cur.executemany() ==> This method works like the execute method but this method passes a sequence of parameters to the cursor and so that could perform a sql command on a number of parameters.

csv.reader() ==> This method is used to read csv files which further returns the reader object that will iterate over the lines given in the csvfile. 


random.uniform() ==> This method finds a random number between the values that we enter in the uniform method. 


datetime.datetime.now() ==> This command uses the datetime module that is built-in python and it prints the time at which this command is run.
